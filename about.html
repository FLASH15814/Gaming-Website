            <h1>OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
            <p>
                Valhalla Games has acquired Xilinx, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Xilinx”), and the entities are in the process of combining their operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Valhalla Games will continue collecting and processing personal information as set forth in the Valhalla Games Privacy Policy below.  As a result of the acquisition, Xilinx will collect and process personal information as an Valhalla Games affiliate (including sharing personal information with Valhalla Games) subject to the Valhalla Games Privacy Policy.  Valhalla Games and Xilinx’s privacy practices do not materially differ, and Valhalla Games and its affiliates (including Xilinx) will continue to honor your privacy as stated by Xilinx prior to the acquisition.
            </p>
            <p>Until the combination of operations is complete, Valhalla Games and Xilinx each remain responsible for the processing of your personal information where the operations remain separate. For example, when you use the portions of the Xilinx website operated by Xilinx, Xilinx will remain the controller. When you are re-directed to an Valhalla website from the Xilinx website or when Valhalla directly collects personal information through the Xilinx website, Valhalla Games is the controller. You can find more information on the relevant entity below in the section labeled “Information for Individuals Located in the European Economic Area, UK, and Switzerland”.</p>
            <p>
                Where consent is legally required for the processing of your personal information (e.g., in some countries for Xilinx to provide personal information to Valhalla Games for marketing purposes), we will inform you separately to obtain such consent.

            <h1>Personal Information We Collect and Use</h1>
            <p>“Personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, or describes, directly or indirectly, a particular individual, such as: name, address, email address, phone number, or persistent device identifier.</p>
            <p>We collect several categories of personal information from you, depending on the Valhalla Games product, service, or technology you use, including websites operated by Valhalla Games and its affiliates, social media pages, mobile applications, business communications platforms (e.g., Slack), and other online services (“Sites”), or information you otherwise provide to us through our interactions online and offline. We may also collect personal information about you from others. We use personal information for typical business management, operational and commercial purposes (including to defend and protect us and others from harm or legal claims, and as required by applicable law), and as described more specifically below:</p>
            <p>Online submissions: We collect personal information when you interact with us online, including:</p>

            <li>

To register for some events, Valhalla Games may collect date of birth and passport information. If you choose not to register on a Site, you may &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have limited functionality. For example, you will not be able to participate in forum discussions on a Site without registering.

                Commercial transaction information. We collect and generate commercial transaction information (such as records of products and services purchased) when you make purchases or register products on a Site. We may use this information &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deliver and fulfill your orders, refer you to distributors and partners to assist you with your requests, improve our product and service offerings, tailor our marketing efforts, and administer accounts.
            </li>
            <li>Online training (including the Valhalla Games Arena Program), event and program information. We collect and generate registration and participation information related to online training and events, such as your results and leader board &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position. We may also collect personal identifiers and professional and employment information for employment verification to ensure you are eligible to participate in online training and redeem Valhalla Games reward points. We use the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information to operate and administer the training and events.</li>
            <li>
                Inferences from the information listed above. Valhalla Games will use the information listed above to draw inferences about your preferences (such as your preferred products), to help us provide you with personalized content and offers, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to help us provide, enhance, and personalize our product, service, and technology offerings and the Sites.

            </h1>
            <p>
                Valhalla Games will take reasonable steps to protect personal information. We use a variety of advanced security technologies and procedures to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. For example, when we transmit sensitive personal information over the internet, we use encryption. Please help us to keep your personal information secure by not using an obvious login name or password or giving your password to others. Although we make efforts to secure your personal information, we cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information you transmit to us online.

These transfers can take place within the Valhalla Games group of affiliates and subsidiaries but also to selected third parties (as explained in the ‘Disclosure of Information’ section of this Privacy Policy). Not all countries have laws offering the same level of protection for personal information as those where you are located when your personal information is received by Valhalla Games.  Valhalla Games will take reasonable steps to transfer personal information using measures consistent with the legal requirements applicable to the personal information.

            <p>European Economic Area (“EEA"), United Kingdom (“UK”) and Swiss data protection laws offer additional rights and protections for individuals located in these countries. Further to the information set out in the ‘Your Privacy Rights’ section of this Privacy Policy, the following additional information applies to you if you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland:</p>
            <li><b>Controller :</b> 
            The controller of the website www.ValhallaGames.com is
                Advanced Micro Devices, 2485 Augustine Drive, Santa Clara, U.S.A.

            <li><b>Basics of Processing :</b> Where you give us your personal information to receive or use a product, service, or technology from us, we process your personal information on the basis that such processing is necessary to give effect to the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contract between us. Where you give us your personal information for any other reason, we process your personal information for our legitimate business purposes to respond to your request (for example, providing you with access to our &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sites or providing you with direct marketing that you have requested) or on the basis of your explicit consent.</li>
            <li><b>Personal information rights:</b> In addition to your right to access personal information we hold about you (as set out in the ‘Your Privacy Rights’ section of this Privacy Policy), you have the right to have your personal information rectified or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;erased, to object to its processing, or to restrict access to it.

If Valhalla Games or any of its affiliates previously transferred personal information pursuant to the EU-U.S. or Swiss- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, such information is now protected by the European Commission’s Standard Contract Clauses. For further information on or to receive a copy of the adequate safeguards we have adopted, please contact the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication Preference Centre.
